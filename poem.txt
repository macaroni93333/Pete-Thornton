In the realm of void, whispers so light,
A tale unfolds, of nothing's delight.
Empty spaces, an infinite flight,
No words to bind, nor stars to alight.

In nothingness, a dance takes place,
A void so vast, no bounds to trace.
Silent symphony, no rhythm to chase,
Yet beauty blooms in this boundless space.

No colors paint this canvas bare,
No melodies hum in the empty air.
A blank page, a poet's despair,
Yet nothing holds a mystery rare.

Embrace the nothing, let it be,
A canvas vast, for minds to see.
In nothing's depths, creativity,
A universe of possibilities set free.
